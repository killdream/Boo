Boo
===

Boo is a minimal javascript library to provide better prototypal inheritance,
including a very basic trait system.


Downloading
-----------

Boo is nicely hosted (and developed) on [Github][]. You can
[download the lastest snapshot][snapshot] or clone the entire
repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/killdream/boo.git
    
[Github]:   https://github.com/killdream/boo
[snapshot]: https://github.com/killdream/boo/zipball/master


Running tests
-------------

You'll need Node.js and [Claire][] to run the test cases. You should get
Claire automagically while cloning the repository. If you're using git
though, you'll have to clone it manually.

Please refer to the `.hgsub` file in the root directory for the path and
url for each dependency.

To run the test suite:

    $ cd tests
    $ node suite.js

Documentation
-------------

Currently, there are no docs. Just refer to the source code, as they
explain the code in great detail ({i,}literate programming, etc)

  boss!
