Bone is the core library of b., it's meant to abstract away some of the nasty
parts of the standard ECMAScript (and the browser JavaScript library), and fill
in the gaps of features that are really important to have.

As such, the goal of Bone is to be a minimalist wrapper over such features, as
to not add too much overhead in the final code.
