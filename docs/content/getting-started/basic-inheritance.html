§§ blurb

Boo exposes four main methods for dealing with inheritance: `inherit`,
for inheriting behaviours; `extend` for extending behaviours; and
`upper` for accessing inherited behaviours.

~~~js~~~
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name
}
boo.extend(Person.prototype, function() {
    return { speak: speak }
    
    function speak(what) {
        return this.name + ': ' + what
    }
}())

boo.inherit(Student, Person.prototype)
function Student(name, school) {
    boo.upper(this, 'constructor', name)
    this.school = school
}
boo.extend(Student.prototype, function() {
    return { study_at: study_at }
                     
    function study_at() {
        return this.speak('I study at ' + this.school)
    }
}())

## Inheriting behaviours

An object in JavaScript is simply a collection of `key=value` pairs (or
properties). We name this collection *behaviour*. Each object define its
own behaviours, directly, rather than storing it in a class.
