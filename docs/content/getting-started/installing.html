§§ blurb

Getting Boo up and running is *easy-peasy*: Just put an script tag at
the bottom of your page.

~~~html~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head> <!-- ... --> </head>
<body>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script src="path/to/boo.js"></script>
    <script>/\* Use Boo here \*/</script>
</body>
</html>
~~~~~~~~~~

Or, if you're running Node.js:

~~~js~~~
var boo = require('/path/to/boo')
~~~~~~~~

## Dependencies

Boo depends on the recent ECMAScript 5 additions, such as the functional
array methods and the prototypical inheritance additions. If you want it
to work on old dinosaurs, you can just include the awesome [es5-shim][]
library.

Otherwise, just make sure the platform supports the following:

- [Object.getPrototypeOf][]
- [Object.keys][]
- [Object.create][]
- [Array.prototype.forEach][]



## Resolving conflicts

On platforms that don't support CommonJS modules, Boo will take hold of
the global `boo`. If you happen to have something else named `boo` in
the global scope, you can resolve the conflict by calling
`boo.make_local`:

~~~html~~~
<script>
    window.boo = 'boo'
</script>
<script src="/path/to/boo.js"></script>
<script>
    alert(boo) // [object Object]
    var my_boo = boo.make_local()
    alert(boo) // 'boo'
</script>
~~~~~~~~~~

## Special properties

Boo uses the `$traits`, `$ctx` and `$super` properties in objects for a
range of stuff, so avoid writing to those in objects that are going to
be used by the library ;3
