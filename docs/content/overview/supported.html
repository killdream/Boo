§§ blurb

Boo should work in any ECMAScript 5-compliant environment — like Node.js,
Chrome and Firefox. Just load it and hack away.

§§ /blurb


Boo depends on the functional Array additions from JavaScript 1.6, plus
[Object.getPrototypeOf][], [Object.keys][] and [Object.create][].


[Object.getPrototypeOf]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/GetPrototypeOf
[Object.keys]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[Object.create]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create
