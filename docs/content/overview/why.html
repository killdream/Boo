§§ blurb

JavaScript has a nice prototypical inheritance system, but its
implementation is just broken. Boo abstract the bad bits of this
implementation in a neat package, while maintaining all the sweetness of
prototypes.

§§ /blurb


The goal here is to provide a handier prototypal inheritance structure
for JavaScript programs, by adding new functions to deal with the usual
pattern in a sane way, as well as introducing a new system to deal with
*multiple-inheritance* — traits.

Note that the Traits system implemented by this library is not the
same as the one in Self; This system is, in fact, closer to `mixins`
than actual `Traits`.


## Objects and inheritance

There are a handful of problems with the way JavaScript handles
inheritance out of the box. And I'm not talking about being prototypical
— since that's one of the best things about it.

For one, you can't inherit directly from other objects. ES5 introduced
[Object.create][], but it's not available everywhere, and even so, the
usage is not the most pleasing one.

There's no `extend` function built-in, which means that once you've set
the prototype for a constructor, you have to manually set all of the
functions too. This also means you don't get to extend the prototype
with other objects very nicely (out of the box, of course).

Calling `super` methods requires hard-coded parents, which doesn't work
when you have things like traits extended directly on the
prototype. Capatibilities of parents aren't implemented either — testing
which one implements which attributes.

To solve this, the module provides six new functions: `inherit`,
`upper`, `extend`, `clone`, `plugin` and `can`, which are discussed in
more detail through this documentation.
